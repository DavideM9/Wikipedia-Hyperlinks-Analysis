# Homework 5 - Visit the Wikipedia hyperlinks graph!
In this assignment we perform an analysis of the Wikipedia Hyperlink graph. In particular, given extra information about the
categories to which an article belongs to, we are curious to rank the articles according to some criteria.

## Data to analyse.
We downloaded the files we were given in the homework text. The files are 3:
 - in `wiki-topcats-reduced.txt` there are all the edges between the articles;
 - in `wiki-topcats-categories.txt` second there are all the categpries, and the for each category there is the list of the articles belonging to it;
 - in `wiki-topcats-page-names.txt` last one there are the names of all the articles, so is specified the number of the article and his name.
 
## Jupyter Notebook
`Homework05.ipynb` is a IPython notebook in which are displayed the methods we used.
